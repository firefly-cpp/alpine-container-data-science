# upgrade base packages & install packages
# firstly, we add a testing repository (some packages that were not moved to the community yet, live there)
# NOTE: the base image (alpine:3.17, etc) is only updated when minor releases happen (3.17.1, etc), so it's likely
# there might be a change to libssl or busybox that wouldn't be pulled when installing packages; thus, we apply 'apk upgrade' step.
